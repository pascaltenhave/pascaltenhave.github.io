Hello World,
I'm Pascal ten Have. AForestry Engineer and Journalist by background, currently working on becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer. 

After a few years in politics as a spokesperson and a journalist, I realized this wouldnâ€™t bring me satisfaction on the long term. So my partner and I packed our bags and hit the road for a couple of years to gain new experiences in Latin America and Oceania. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and my job as a travel-guide was no longer tenable, I was confronted with the fact that my lifestyle needed a more resilient and location independent job. I followed through on my passion for logical thinking and technology, and decided to study web development. While studying remotely through targeted courses on SkillCrush, Wes Bos Courses and edX, I developed a special interest in JavaScript and subsequently React, but also have experience with Python, CSS, HTML, PHP, Node.js and MongoDB.
